Hello there! I'm a second-year software engineering student with a passion for solving problem and developing solutions using code. I like learning new technologies and applying them to real-world projects, particularly those involving web development, data structures, and algorithms. While I am currently exploring many aspects of software engineering, I'm eager to keep learning and growing my skills.
